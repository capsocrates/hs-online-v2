<h1>HS Online - Google Doc FAQs</h1>
<ol>
<li>So, what is the <strong>Google Doc string</strong> that you are referring to?
	<ul>
		<li>If this is your Google Doc URL: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/<strong>1MHPjonnEtiK73rALXVDITJerej897dfjkdsJo</strong>/edit<br />
		the bold part is the Google Doc string that you need to paste into HS Online.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Why won't my Google Doc open up in HS Online?
	<ul>
		<li>You first need to sign in to Google Docs in order to open up the doc.   Please do this <strong>before</strong> logging on to HeroSkype.  Maybe in the future, we will figure out a way to tie in the login with the Google Doc API...</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<li>What if I don't want to open up a Google Doc?
	<ul>
		<li>No sweat!  You don't have to open one up, and you can even resize your browser so that only the left column of HeroSkype tools is viewable.  That way, you can set it next to another browser window.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>When using FireFox, the Google Doc won't size to the full height of my browser!
	<ul>
		<li>This is one of the few times where it is actually better to use Chrome browser.  For now, FireFox will display the Google Doc with a fized height of 800 pixels.</li>
	</ul>
